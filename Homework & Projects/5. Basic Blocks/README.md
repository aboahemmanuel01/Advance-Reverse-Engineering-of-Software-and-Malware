# Basic Blocks

The preamble to this assigmnet was to:

Modify your entry_point.py code (or start with the provided solution) to identify basic blocks.  Call your
program `basic_blocks.py`.  Store the basic blocks and then, at the end, print them in order by address.

Accept a file name followed by a (possibly empty) series of hexadecimal addresses as command line 
arguments and assume these are basic block leaders.  If no addresses are given on the command line, add 
the entry point to the stack as a basic block leader.

Print the block leader address, the block disassembly indented two spaces, and the next address(es) after
the block.  If you don't know the addresses, print "unknown."

The expected output should be like below:
```
$ python3 basic_blocks.py `which python3`
/usr/bin/python3:
block at: 0x5cff70
endbr64
xor ebp, ebp
mov r9, rdx
pop rsi
mov rdx, rsp
and rsp, 0xfffffffffffffff0
push rax
push rsp
mov r8, 0x679500
mov rcx, 0x679490
mov rdi, 0x4cf960
call qword ptr [rip + 0x26905a]
hlt
next: unknown
```
