	; Save our arguments on the stack because we are going to call other
	; functions, and it is easier than trying to save rsi and edi every
	; time.
	;
	; We want to save edi (an int), and rsi (a quad word).  We really don't
	; need to save rdx (the environment pointer), so we won't.  We do want
	; to reserve space for a temporary value, so we will want 8 more bytes.
	;
	; The stack grows "backward" in memory.  That is, as you push items
	; the stack pointer is decreased.  So to reserve memory on the stack
	; we just subtract the space needed.  Additonally, it is a Good Idea
	; for the stack to be aligned on a 16-byte boundary.
	; 
	; Prior to the call, the stack was aligned.  Then the call pushed the
	; return address (8 bytes) on the stack, and the stack was not aligned.
	; Then we pushed rbp (8 bytes) and it was aligned again.  So we need to
	; reserve a multiple of 16 to make sure it is still aligned.  The least
	; multiple of 16 that is greater or equal to 20 is 32.
	; 
	; A strategy you sometimes see is to reserve what you need, then force
	; alignment.

	; Remember the stack grows backward, so if we stored at [rbp] we would
	; overwrite the old stack!  The first mov will put the four bytes of
	; edi in [rbp-4], [rbp-3], [rbp-2], and [rbp-1].
